# Rails forms & validations


## What will we talk about?

- rails way of handling forms:
- - `form_for`
- - `form_tag`
- validating user input on the model
- strong params
- communicating between http requests using `flash`
- using partials

## Let's get familiar with the app.

## Discuss: In the process of creation a resource - what kind of request do we make, what gets sent?

- `form for` - Directly works with a model. All the fields of the form should match with a model. It's important to remember that you need to create a new object instance on the `new` method in the controller.
- get into byebug and look at params - note where things are and what's inside. Esp. the 'permitted' part. You can only allow permitted params to be accepted.
- strong params to rescue! `cupcake_params`. Pass exactly what's needed. You decide what's sent to AR!

code:
``` ruby
  private
  def cupcake_params
    params.require(:cupcake).permit(:name, :price)
  end
```

```ruby
  def create
    @cupcake = Cupcake.create(cupcake_params)
    if @cupcake.valid?
      redirect_to @cupcake
    else
      redirect_to new_cupcake_path
    end
  end

  def update
    @cupcake.update(cupcake_params)
    if @cupcake.valid?
      redirect_to @cupcake
    else
      redirect_to edit_cupcake_path(@cupcake)
    end
  end
```

## validation - why and how

- How do we prevent people from creating empty / invalid entries?
- Look up Rails Guides validations!

code:

```ruby
  validates :name, uniqueness: true, presence: true
  validates :price, presence: true, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 0, only_integer: true}
```

- This works for edit and new - due to the fact that it's on the model.
- What happens after unsuccessful creation? Redirect to `index`. That's poor user experience. Look at SQL logs and see rollbacks.
- try out: `cupcake.valid?` and `cupcake.errors`

HTTP requests are stateless. Not really... 

## enter `flash`

```ruby
# in the controller
  def create
    @cupcake = Cupcake.create(cupcake_params)
    if @cupcake.valid?
      redirect_to @cupcake
    else
      flash[:errors] = @cupcake.errors.full_messages
      redirect_to new_cupcake_path
    end
  end

  def update
    @cupcake.update(cupcake_params)
    if @cupcake.valid?
      redirect_to @cupcake
    else
      flash[:errors] = @cupcake.errors.full_messages
      redirect_to edit_cupcake_path(@cupcake)
    end
  end
```

```ruby
  #in the views for new and edit
    <% if flash[:errors] %>
        <ul>
            <% flash[:errors].each do |error| %>
            <li><%= error %></li>
            <% end %>
        </ul>
    <% end %>
```

## before_action

`before_action :set_cupcake, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]`

```ruby
  def set_cupcake
    @cupcake = Cupcake.find(params[:id])
  end
```

## partials
- how does new/edit form know what is its http verb?
- deleting can't be done w/ a form_for - why?


```ruby
# delete code
<%= form_tag cupcake_path, method: "delete" do %>
  <%= submit_tag "Delete Cupcake" %>
<% end %>
```

## code challenge talk

- Validations will be on code challenge! Not custom ones, though.
- Before_action is not going to be there. Nor the partials.
